Quickstart
==========


Installation
------------

Pyfood is a simple Python package to process food, in different languages

.. code-block:: console

	$ pip install pyfood

will install Pyfood alongside all the other libraries that you will need to run it.

Examples
--------

At the core of Pyfood is the concept of a ``shelf`` embedded in a given ``region``, a certain ``month_id`` and optionally a ``source`` language.
You can load a shelf embedded in France in January with the following Python snippet:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from pyfood.utils import Shelf
    shelf = Shelf(region='France', month_id=0)

Pyfood currently works with the following regions: **France** ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, **Italy** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, **Spain** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, **Portugal** ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, **Germany** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, **EU** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (Europe, default), **United Kingdom** ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, **Canada** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, **Japan** ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, **Israel** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± and **Senegal** ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡³.
Pyfood can help automatically extract and label a list of ingredients, e.g., from a basket of food, a recipe, a menu, a cookbook or a website, with attributes/categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables) and labels (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, nutrition, seasonality), using a few lines of code.

.. code-block:: python

    results = shelf.process_ingredients(['apple','kiwi','sugar'])
    results['labels'] # vegetarian, vegan, nutrition, seasonality

Pyfood comes with a vocabulary of more than 600 ingredients and synonymes, in multiple languages, and makes it easy to work with recipes in different languages or translate ingredients from a language to another one.

.. code-block:: python

    results = shelf.process_ingredients(['apple','kiwi','sugar'], lang_dest='FR')
    results['food_list'] # pomme, kiwi, sucre

Pyfood currently supports the following languages **EN** (English), **FR** (French), **ES** (Spanish), **IT** (Italian), **DE** (German), **PT** (Portuguese) and **UN** (Universal, default). Finally, Pyfood can also be used to simply query what fruits or vegetables are in season, which depends on the ``region`` and ``month_id`` selected.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits_in_season = shelf.get_seasonal_food(key='001')
    vegetables_in_season = shelf.get_seasonal_food(key='002')
