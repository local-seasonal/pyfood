Pyfood documentation
====================


Pyfood is a simple Python package to process food, in different languages.
It can help to **extract, translate, label** ingredients from a basket of food, a recipe or a cookbook with multiple labels, e.g. vegetarian, vegan, nutrition or seasonality. Pyfood comes with a vocabulary of more than 600 ingredients and synonymes, and makes it easy to work with data in different languages.
