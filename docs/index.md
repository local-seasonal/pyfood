Pyfood documentation
====================


Pyfood is a simple Python package to process food, in different languages.
It can be used to extract ingredients from a list of words, label food with categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables) and baskets or recipes with labels (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, nutrition or seasonality). Pyfood comes with a vocabulary of more than 600 ingredients and synonymes, and makes it easy to work with data in different languages or translate ingredients from a language to another one.
